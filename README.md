# Family Practice Enrollment System

This application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It streamlines the process of onboarding new patients to family practices through a secure and user-friendly web-based system. The system allows for multiple user roles (admin, doctor, user) with appropriate session management to ensure secure and efficient operations.

## Overview

The system aims to solve the issue of cumbersome paper forms and lengthy onboarding processes in family practices. Patients can apply to meet with specific doctors, and both the patient and the doctor are notified of the appointment. The system is managed by an admin, ensuring the smooth coordination of appointments and notifications.

### Features

- **Multiple User Roles**: The system has three rolesâ€”admin, doctor, and user. Each role has specific permissions and access rights.
- **Secure Session Management**: To ensure the security and integrity of user sessions, the system follows strict session management standards.
- **Appointment System**: Users can apply for an appointment with a specific doctor, triggering notifications for both parties upon successful application.
- **PDF Generation**: The system generates a PDF document upon completion of the patient enrollment form, providing a copy of the patient's information.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: The user interface is designed for ease of use, with straightforward navigation and form completion.

## Technical Requirements

- **MERN Stack**: The application is built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
- **Data Capture**: Captures all the information requested in the patient enrollment form.
- **Data Validation**: Implements basic form validation to ensure patients provide correct information.
- **PDF Generation**: Automatically generates a PDF document upon form completion.

## Development Setup

To run this project locally, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. Here's how to get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/barath-sk17/thrive-health-problem.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd thrive-health-problem
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
6. Start the Front-end Server
   In a separate terminal, navigate to the `client` folder and start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
7. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Server Dependencies (Node.js/Express.js):

- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords. It provides secure hashing with salting for user authentication.
- **bcryptjs**: A JavaScript-only implementation of bcrypt, used for environments where the native `bcrypt` module doesn't work well.
- **dotenv**: Allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. Useful for managing sensitive configuration data.
- **express**: A popular web framework for Node.js, used for building server-side applications and APIs.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT), commonly used for authentication and authorization.
- **mongoose**: An ODM (Object-Document Mapper) for MongoDB, simplifying the process of interacting with a MongoDB database.
- **mongoose-gridfs**: Middleware to manage files stored in MongoDB's GridFS, enabling file storage and retrieval within the database.
- **multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads in Express applications.
- **multer-gridfs-storage**: Integrates `multer` with MongoDB's GridFS for file storage.
- **nodemon**: A development tool that automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.

### Client Dependencies (React.js):

- **@reduxjs/toolkit**: A utility library for Redux that simplifies Redux development with modern tools and patterns.
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**, **@testing-library/react**, **@testing-library/user-event**: Libraries for testing React components and DOM interactions.
- **antd**: A popular UI library for React with a set of components and design principles.
- **ascii85**: Encoding/decoding library, perhaps used for handling data in a specific format.
- **axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests.
- **bcrypt**: It's unusual to have `bcrypt` on the client-side. Be cautious with handling sensitive operations in client-side code.
- **moment**: A library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
- **react**, **react-dom**: Core React libraries for building user interfaces.
- **react-hot-toast**: A library for creating toast notifications in React.
- **react-redux**: A binding library that integrates Redux with React components.
- **react-router-dom**: Library for handling client-side routing in React applications.
- **react-scripts**: Scripts and configurations for Create React App.
- **redux**: A predictable state management library.
- **redux-toolkit**: Part of Redux Toolkit, an improvement over traditional Redux development.
- **web-vitals**: A library for measuring important web performance metrics.
- **proxy**: Redirects frontend API requests to the backend (set to `http://localhost:5000`).
