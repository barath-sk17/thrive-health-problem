# Family Practice Enrollment System

This application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It streamlines the process of onboarding new patients to family practices through a secure and user-friendly web-based system. The system allows for multiple user roles (admin, doctor, user) with appropriate session management to ensure secure and efficient operations.

## Overview

The system aims to solve the issue of cumbersome paper forms and lengthy onboarding processes in family practices. Patients can apply to meet with specific doctors, and both the patient and the doctor are notified of the appointment. The system is managed by an admin, ensuring the smooth coordination of appointments and notifications.

### Features

- **Multiple User Roles**: The system has three rolesâ€”admin, doctor, and user. Each role has specific permissions and access rights.
- **Secure Session Management**: To ensure the security and integrity of user sessions, the system follows strict session management standards.
- **Appointment System**: Users can apply for an appointment with a specific doctor, triggering notifications for both parties upon successful application.
- **PDF Generation**: The system generates a PDF document upon completion of the patient enrollment form, providing a copy of the patient's information.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: The user interface is designed for ease of use, with straightforward navigation and form completion.

## Technical Requirements

- **MERN Stack**: The application is built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
- **Data Capture**: Captures all the information requested in the patient enrollment form.
- **Data Validation**: Implements basic form validation to ensure patients provide correct information.
- **PDF Generation**: Automatically generates a PDF document upon form completion.
